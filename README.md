## `improved_ensemble_methods_for_heart_disease_prediction`
I leveraged on an improved ensemble techniques for developing a stochastic model for predicting if an individual suffers from heart diseases.

#### Multi-Ensemble Techniques

Leveraged on the improved performance of high performing algorithms. Multiple algorithms were trained on the dataset and evaluating each metrics to determine which of the algorithms is best in terms of performance metrics - `[accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score]`.
After a comprehensive hyperparameter tunning on all models, a voting classifier is used to vote the best algorithms and the architecture designed.

#### Metrics Evaluation

Clearly, the model makes prediction and identify each labels correctly as measured by the performance metrics.
